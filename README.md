## A Vision of Legacy

The Maestre Arco Conservatory is not a music learning application; it is the materialisation of a dream. Inspired by the transformative impact of José Antonio Abreu's "El Sistema," this project was born with the mission to democratise elite music education on a global scale. It is a digital sanctuary where the most advanced artificial intelligence meets classical tradition, creating a learning experience that is profoundly personal, immersive, and accessible to all, regardless of their location or resources.

This project is a testament to the power of technology to elevate the human spirit, forged with pristine code and an unwavering vision.

## Features — The Technological Symphony

- **Faculty of AI Maestres:** Four unique AI tutors (Maestre Arco, Arcoida, Rigab, Esmeralda) with distinct personalities, neural voices (Web Speech API), and teaching styles.
- **Personalised Diagnosis & Curriculum:** An initial conversation with Maestre Arco uses AI (Gemini) to generate a student profile and a completely bespoke 10-module curriculum.
- **Offline-First with Chrome AI:** The core of teaching and interaction functions without an internet connection, utilising Chrome's AI APIs (Gemini Nano) to ensure universal access.
- **Eternal Biometric Credential:** After the diagnosis, the student captures their portrait and receives a credential with a cryptographically signed QR code (Web Crypto API), their eternal pass to the Conservatory.
- **Live Tutor (Gemini Live API):** A real-time, low-latency audio conversation experience with the Maestres for tutorials, doubt resolution, and conversational practice.
- **Specialised Classrooms:** Interactive classrooms designed for each discipline, from the playful "Salon Mozart" for children to the solemn "Grand Hall of Instruments".
- **Library of Extensions:** Generation and download of digitally signed Chrome extensions so that students can take their AI Tutor with them in their browser.
- **Verifiable Diploma:** Upon completing the curriculum, a personalised and cryptographically signed diploma is awarded, immortalising the student's achievement.
- **Security and Authorship:** The entire system, from credentials to extensions, is digitally signed with HMAC-SHA256, with the exclusive authorship of **RICHARD FELIPE URBINA** engraved at its core.

## Architecture and Student Flow

The journey is designed as a progressive and coherent ceremony:

1.  **The Entrance Doors:** A cinematic experience welcomes the student. A Gemini API Key is requested to power the online features.
2.  **The Lobby:** Maestre Arco receives the student with a solemn speech.
3.  **The Diagnosis:** A conversation with the AI to define the student's profile and learning path.
4.  **Credentialing:** Creation of the biometric identity and the eternal QR code.
5.  **The Library:** Downloading the offline learning tools.
6.  **The Grand Hall:** Generation and presentation of the personalised curriculum.
7.  **The Classroom:** The student attends their first lesson in the salon corresponding to their profile.
8.  **The Live Tutor:** A real-time conversation session with the Maestre of their choice.
9.  **The Diploma Hall:** Graduation ceremony and awarding of the final certificate.
